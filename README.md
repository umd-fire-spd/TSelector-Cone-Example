# TSelector-Cone-Example
This is an example ROOT TSelector code that will loop over some simulation hits, apply a simple cone algorithm to calculate calorimeter energy deposition associated with a particle.
The algorithm is adapted from the hatakeyamak/HGCalAnalysis package, and further modified by FIRE SPD students.
